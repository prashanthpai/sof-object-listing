Tested on Fedora

1. yum install inotify-tools, erlang
2. Download and install rabbitmq from: https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-rpm.html
   yum localinstall ./rabbitmq-server-3.3.4-1.noarch.rpm
3. pip install pika
4. service rabbitmq-server start
   chkconfig rabbitmq-server on

Assuming you already have SAIO setup with SOF configured as a storage policy.

STEP 1:

./inotifywait /mnt/swiftonfile/test

This listens for file creation/deletion events and if relevant to SOF, puts it in a RabbitMQ queue.
Ideally, we would want to monitor brick directory "/mnt/brick-test/b" but currently, .glusterfs
directory inside brick is exhausting too many inotify watches. Until that's addressed, we stick
to glusterfs mount point.


STEP 2:

./daemon.py /mnt/brick-test/b 2

This consumes the RabbitMQ queue and sends requests to container-server to add/remove entries from container DB
In the above example, 2 is the SP index assigned to SOF storage policy.
