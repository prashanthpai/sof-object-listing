Tested on Fedora

1. yum install inotify-tools, erlang
2. Download and install rabbitmq from: https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-rpm.html
   yum localinstall ./rabbitmq-server-3.3.4-1.noarch.rpm
3. pip install pika
4. service rabbitmq-server start
   chkconfig rabbitmq-server on

Assuming you already have SAIO setup with SOF configured as a storage policy.

Start inotifywait.py: This listens for file creation/deletion events and if relevant to SOF, puts it a RabbitMQ queue.
./inotifywait /mnt/brick-test/b

Start daemon.py: This consumes the RabbitMQ queue and sends requests to container-server to add/remove entries from container DB
./daemon.py /mnt/brick-test/b 2
